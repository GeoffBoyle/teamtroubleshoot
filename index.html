        As a group we decided on the name “Team Troubleshoot”. We thought it was a memorable name
        and the term troubleshoot is one that is relatable to IT.

        I’m Bryce – 25 years old and have just begun studying IT in order to expand my skillset.
        I’ve moved back and forth between Ballarat and Melbourne the last few years, and have finally settled down back in Ballarat where I was born.
        I currently work for a small company building high-end custom PCs for both personal and commercial use.
        My role is essentially assembling, testing and troubleshooting our products. I’ve always had a passion for the hardware side of computing,
        and hoping to expand my knowledge into the software side of things.
        When I’m not working or tinkering, I play in a few bands locally and have a passion for audio engineering and sound production;
        I’m most often found in my sketchy home studio amongst a tangle of cables and gear.

        My name is Geoffrey Boyle and I am currently studying the Bachelor of Information Technology at
        RMIT University. I am a member of Team Troubleshoot for our assessment tasks. I am currently 43
        years of age and was born in Brisbane, Australia. My current employer is Australia Post, for the
        past 13 years as a Postal Delivery Officer. My interests and hobbies consist of travelling,
        playing rugby league, watching movies, fishing, and working with computers.
        My interest in IT started back at high school, there are many different areas that I enjoy.
        For that reason, the current field that I would like to pursue is still currently undecided.
        Ideally to become multi-skilled with Networking, Web Development, and some Programming would be
        my dream. With the variety of subjects on offer from RMIT University, it will expand my knowledge
        and through study, I will find the career pathway that I will pursue in the future. My current
        experience in IT relates to building computers, upgrading, diagnosing problems and repairs.
        After completing high school in 1995, I had continued further study in Web Development, however
        I need to retrain my skills in this field.

        My name is Mitchell and I am a member of Team Troubleshoot. I am studying a Bachelor of
        Information Technology at RMIT University and have a strong passion for technology and
        software development. I grew up in Queensland, Australia and began my degree there while I
        was working as a Business Analyst at a technology company in Brisbane City. Since then I have
        moved to Scotland, UK and studying remotely from there while also working as a software
        engineer. I have been working as a software developer for 1-2 years now and predominately am
        focused on frontend development using Vue.js, but also work on some backend systems in PHP.
        Currently some of my favourite tech I am playing with is Vue.js (with a close eye on the
        upcoming v3 release), DevOps CI/CD, serverless development and containerization (Docker and
        Kubernetes). If I am not playing around with tech I play (well played thanks to the pandemic)
        a lot of social sport, including AFL, touch football and indoor soccer.

        My name is Sam Fairbrother and I am apart of Team Troubleshoot. I am currently living in Canberra
        where I work as a chef in an Italian restaurant. I moved from my hometown of Newcastle in 2018 as
        I was enrolled to study computer science at the ANU. I later had to withdraw from this course as
        I had some health problems that required me to return home for a while. However, I have stayed in
        Canberra as my fiancé has work obligations here. I am studying the Bachelor of IT through OUA as
        I still have a great passion for IT and aim to start a career in the IT field. My main areas of
        interest are business information systems and cyber security. My interests and hobbies include
        cooking, rugby, gaming, and spending time by the beach. My interest in IT started when I began
        playing video games when I was younger, this introduced me to the world of IT and eventually my
        intrigue led me to learning more about different aspects of IT. Regarding my experience in IT, I
        have always been the nominated IT-problem-solver of the household, whether it be fixing a computer,
        the internet, printers etc, so I have had a lot of exposure to little things like this that then
        require me to further research to solve the problem. One of the things that I love about IT is the
        ability to solve a problem just through self-research online, and the great feeling that you get when
        you are able to fix something.

        Victoria and now i reside in Brisbane, Queensland. I am undertaking a bachelor of IT
        and my most up to date education is high school. Even thought I grew up in Melbourne my
        nationality is Turkish/Australian, which means I also know Turkish as well and a little
        bit of Arabic. I work in Aviation as a ground operations officer at Brisbane Airport (BNE).
        An interesting fact about me is that even though I love Holdens very much and own one myself,
        I was very close †o buying a Ford and ruining my loyalty to Holden, sadly I am also
        devastated that the great lion will not be with us any longer.

        Some hobbies of mine are Tennis, video games, TV shows but mostly working on my car.
        Fixing it myself and learning new stuff while at it. The most recent modification I
        have done to it was installing a remote start module which allows it to remotly start with the
        key, while pressing the lock button 3 times without the key even being inside the car.

      <h2 class="mb-5">Project Plan/Description</h2>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>Aims</h3>
      <p>
        Team Troubleshoot’s aim is to create a prototype of a User-friendly app
        to record and keep track of assets. This app will be aimed at the home
        user to keep track of assets for insurance and tax claim purposes.
        Our app needs to have a clean modern design, functionality that is easy
        to follow for all users, Safe and secure data storage, Photo Scanning
        technology and a promotional video to show off all the features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Justification for this application is that there is a very small range
        of home inventory applications that give the freedom to store what you
        want and need. Our app will allow the user to add their own fields, Scan
        in photos, receipts, products from the internet. Our app will make sure
        the most information is recorded and available for the user as soon as
        they need it. All this information will improve tax returns and keep 
        insurance claims delay free. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve this larger goal, we will need to complete smaller tasks within
        the application, first goal would be to complete research of android app
        development and the possibility of using MIT Inventor to create the prototype.
        Research is essential when starting something new so looking at the skills
        we have and the tools we can use will be vital to starting this project.
        As we all have different coding knowledge, we think that using MIT Inventor
        to create the prototype would be a beneficial call as block-based coding 
        is easier and faster to research and learn. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The most important goal is to create the back end or functionality of the
        application. This backend will handle all the user interactions, Passing Data,
        displaying the visuals correctly and allowing for the user to access and interact
        with the application. By completing the functionality of the application early
        on it allows for further testing, risk assessment and designing to take place
        all greatly impacting the quality, efficiency and usability of the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Data storage and security is a great concern for our team, one of our essential goals
        are to ensure all data is stored appropriately and secure. Storing data securely is
        extremely important to protect our data we record for the user. This data has sensitive
        financial information which should not be seen by unauthorised personnel, with storing
        this data in the cloud it brings both opportunity for security as well as risk that we
        will need to discover. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Team Troubleshoots app needs to have a clean, modern, and function design not only functionally
        but visually. We need to create high quality visual elements and style for our app. This
        design will ensure the app is professional, easy to understand, visually appealing and easy
        to use. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The scanning feature is a unique feature that will separate our app from the competitors, 
        this feature will allow you to scan in receipts to import information and allow the user 
        to take a picture of the product and the app will find as much more relevant information 
        using the name, image recognition and any other information given. This allows you to add 
        more information about your asset without having to do research or investigating. This feature 
        gives the user more of a premium experience making the asset recording process easier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a promotional video will help to bring awareness of the project. This promotional
        video is aimed to get home users to download the app and try the service we are providing. 
        This promotional video needs to be professional, short sharp and straight to the point to keep
        the audience's attention. We will include subjects like the description of the app, security and statistics. 
      </p>

      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        The Troubleshooter app and project makes use of a range of different tools and technologies
        to create the final production, as well as the marketing video. When we conducted our
        initial review into building Troubleshooter we went around the team to understand what
        background we had in app development, whether that be web, iOS, Android or other. While
        there was some basic knowledge of iOS development from Mitchell and Android (Java)
        development from Aidian it wasn’t our speciality. Web development was our strongest skill
        with all members being able to get involved in some way shape or form, but Troubleshooter
        was designed to be an app you can run from your phone because portability and the use of
        the camera are some of the foundations of the feature set. This led us to further explore
        options and we came upon a tool called MIT App Inventor.
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-8">
          <p>
            MIT App Inventor is a web app that provides an easy to use interface to get up and running
            with a phone application very quickly and without a deep understanding of all the iOS and
            Android frameworks. MIT App Inventor has been used to create apps such as COVID-19 data
            tracker, bipolar management and scheduling app and apps to help manage share houses. As
            none of the team had experience with this tool, we made some example “dummy apps” and
            quickly realised it would meet the requirements for our first version and prototype of the
            Troubleshooter smart phone application.
          </p>
          <p>
            As MIT App Inventor would cover off everything we needed to build the app (including camera
            and data storage support), we could focus on what we needed to create the marketing video
            for the Troubleshooter app. After another check of the team’s background in storyboarding
            and video editing, we had enough knowledge to get us across the line without too much
            additional learning. We again reviewed the tools and technologies that are available to us
            and had to cross of a handful of them due to the price tag (e.g. Adobe Premiere). We
            decided that we would use iMovie (free) for our video editing app and Microsoft PowerPoint
            as our app for the storyboard. The whole team had experience with PowerPoint and once we
            set out the storyboard template, we could all get involved and Aidian and Mitchell both had
            a small background in basic video editing (albeit with Adobe Premiere) and offered to
            assist with any of the video editing.

      </div>
      <p>
        Outside of the direct technologies required for the Troubleshooter app itself the team
        always relies heavily on the Microsoft Office suite of products and use Microsoft Teams as
        our communication platform as well as Microsoft Word and Notes to consolidate our ideas and
        report writing.
      </p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>
        An important part of designing the application is the testing phase, a plan needs to be put in place to
        ensure everything is working throughout the application. There are many areas that need to be considered
        when testing the design of our new application “Troubleshooter”. The following areas are User Interface
        testing, Functional Testing, Database Testing, Load Testing, Performance, Security Testing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        User Interface testing is required to ensure that the interface will meet user expectations.
        The following areas need to be tested throughout the process.
        <ul>
          <li>Check Screen Validations</li>
          <li>Verify All Navigations</li>
          <li>Check usability Conditions</li>
          <li>Verify Data Integrity</li>
          <li>Verify the object states</li>
          <li>Verify the date Field and Numeric Field Formats</li>
          <li>Verify the compatibility of the User Interface on various platforms (IOS, Android)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional testing is also required to test each function of Troubleshooter’s software application, by
        providing appropriate input and verifying the output against the Functional requirements. The following
        areas need to be addressed in this testing phase.
        <ul>
          <li>Understand the Functional Requirements</li>
          <li>Identify test input or test data based on requirements</li>
          <li>Compute the expected outcomes with selected test input values</li>
          <li>Execute test cases</li>
          <li>Compare actual and computed expected results</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Database testing was also required. This involves performing data validity, data integrity testing,
        performance check related to database and testing of procedures, triggers, and functions in the database.
        From database testing point of view, the following checks should be performed −
        <ul>
          <li>The transactional information from the application should be stored in the database and it should
            provide correct information to the user.</li>
          <li>Information should not be lost when it is loaded to database.</li>
          <li>Only completed transactions should be stored and all incomplete operations should be aborted by the
            application.</li>
          </li>Access authorization to database should be maintained. No unapproved or unauthorized access to
            user information should be provided.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Load testing one among the different kinds of performance testing, this is required to determine the
        performance of the application in real time load conditions. It is basically used to ensure that the
        application performs satisfactorily when many users try to access or use it at the same time. This
        can be performed by -
        <ul>
          <li>Running multiple applications on a computer or server simultaneously</li>
          <li>Subjecting a server to a large amount of traffic</li>
          <li>Writing and reading data to and from a hard disk continuously</li>
        </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      Performance Testing was used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability,
       and resource usage of a software application under a particular workload.
       The focus of Performance Testing was to ensure the application’s
      <ul>
        <li>Speed - Determines whether the application responds quickly</li>
        <li>Scalability - Determines maximum user load the software application can handle.</li>
        <li>Stability - Determines if the application is stable under varying loads</li>
      </ul>
     </p>
     <p>
      Security testing is another important aspect of the application.
      There are four focus areas to be considered in security testing of the application.<br>
      Network security: This involves looking for vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure (resources and
       policies).<br>
      System software security: This involves assessing weaknesses in the various software (operating system,
       database system, and other software) the application depends on.<br>
      Client-side application security: This deals with ensuring that the client (browser or any such tool)
       cannot be manipulated.<br>
      Server-side application security: This involves making sure that the server code and its technologies are
       robust enough to fend off any intrusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarise the testing phase, there are many areas that need to be covered to optimize the performance
       of the application. Ideally 6 test users with skills in the specific areas above would be required to
       focus on each area of the testing phase, however less test users would be required depending on their
       skillset. All hardware devices need to be tested such as photo scanning technology devices, storage,
       computer, and hand-held devices to be compatible with the software used for the application across
       multiple platforms.

    <h3>Timeframe</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Our team's "Troubleshoot" app faces a number of risks that will present themselves both during
      development and well into our hypothetical launch. Outside of the generic risks associated with
      any I.T. project, developing and Android app has its own unique set of risks.
      </p>
    <p>
      Specific to our own group, and the nature of this assignment, inexperience is a very real risk to
      our project: having never developed an Android app before, there is the risk that we may not be
      able to learn, understand and implement advanced techniques (such as OCR) in a reasonable timeframe.
      Inexperience is a unique risk to our project in that the only way to overcome it is to either spend
      increasing amounts of time in order to become experienced, or to add a member to the team that 
      possesses the relevant experience, much like a company would.
      </p>
    <p>
      Another risk is that of being tied to one particular platform. Being an Android app, how many
      potential users are we missing out on? The need to translate the app to accomodate the iOS platform
      down the line may exist, in order to deliver a comprehensive product.
      </p>
    <p>
      Tying into the previous risk, there is the possibility of the application being denied by the
      relevant app store. App store/marketplace rules are always subject to change, and there is no
      guarantee that even a successful implementation of the "Troubleshoot" app will be approved for
      sale.
      </p>
    <p>
      There is also always the risk that the "Troubleshoot" app won't meet the end users' needs. The 
      app may not have the desired features implemented in the way our intended users really need.
      Conversely, our app could potentially have <b>too many</b> features, leaving the end user with 
      difficulty in getting what they need from out app. Our solution will need to be user-friendly
      and concise in what it has to offer, with a well-tailored UI that communicates a wealth of
      features in a simple manner.
</p>
    <h3>Group Processes and Communication</h3>
    <p>
      The members in our team communicate by having meetings twice per week and sending messages through chat 
      using MS Teams. Every meeting, the group discuss the tasks that need to be complete and set goals to have 
      some of these completed by the next meeting.
      </p>
      <p>
      We also discuss the current progress of our assignment, ideas for our website and how to achieve the 
      results required for our project idea. In the meeting agenda notes, we have a progress and things to do
      list. This list allows each of the team members to view our current progress, tasks that each team member 
      are currently working on, and tasks that are still outstanding.
      </p>
      <p>
      If a team member is not present at the meeting, a message is sent through chat on MS Teams, to advise what
      was discussed at the meeting and tasks that are required to be complete. The team member absent is then 
      required to select an incomplete task from the list. If a group member fails to respond, the rest of team 
      work together to take on the additional tasks that have not been completed.
